## **viewstore-simple-demo**

This repo was created after reading the hackernoon article below. I've made some
improvements, although it remains a barebones project that exists to illustrate
the architechture.

To see the demo, install the packages and run the `start:dev` script, along with
the `api` script in a separate tab. They listen on port 3000 and 5000
respectively.

_viewstore-simple-demo was built on mw-starter_

### **mw-starter**

An ejected CRA template, with a express and graphql+relay server using custom
